Java Algorithm Notes

-Insertion, bubble and selection sorts are all quadratic. O(n2)
-Merge sort: divide the array into 2 multiple times until each array element is by itself. Then sort and merge elements.
-Quick Sort: Use a pivot element and divide the array based on the pivot value. Items lower than pivot go to left and
elements more than pivot go right
-counting sort: make assumption about the data. go through the array and count how many values of each there are.
